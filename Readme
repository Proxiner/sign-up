# Validation JavaScript Code Project

This code project includes an HTML form that requires validation before the user is allowed to submit it. The form includes fields for a username, email, password, and confirm password. Additionally, there are eye icons next to the password and confirm password fields that, when clicked, reveal the input value.

## How to Use

To use this code project, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. Fill out the form, making sure to meet the following validation requirements:

- The username field must be filled out
- The email field must be filled out and must be a valid email address format (e.g. "example@example.com")
- The password field must be filled out and must be at least 8 characters long
- The confirm password field must match the password field

When filling out the password and confirm password fields, you can click the eye icon to reveal the input value. This is useful for double-checking that you entered your password correctly.

## How it Works

The `index.html` file creates a basic HTML form with input fields for the username, email, password, and confirm password, as well as submit button. It also includes references to a stylesheet and a JavaScript file.

The `style.css` file includes some basic styling for the form.

The `localstorage.js` file is where the validation logic resides. It includes a `signUp` function that checks whether each field is valid, and either submits the form or displays an error message if any fields are invalid.

Additionally, the `localstorage.js` file includes code that adds an event listener to each eye icon. When the icon is clicked, it toggles the `type` attribute of the associated input field between "password" and "text", which reveals or hides the input value.
